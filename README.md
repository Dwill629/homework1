# Code Refactor

This project gave me a look at a completed index.html and style.css.

I have applied accessibility guidelines to the style.css which lacked defining divs and organization.

I have altered the previous existing code using header, footer, aside, and main classes to provide a better understanding and readability of the code. By applying these specific classes, even though not mandatory for producing a webpage, this has allowed me to also organize the style.css into what I believe is much cleaner code.
